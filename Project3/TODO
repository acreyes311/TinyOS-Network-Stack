Implement transportC.nc and transportP.nc under lib/modules
 - The ones we need to work on for sure: socket, bind, listen, connect; maybe accept and close?
 
- Setup and teardown
- Start of data transfer, stop and wait

- Started working on setTestClient andd setTestServer. Haven't implemented timers that go inside those functions yet.
Still not too sure what exactly we have to implement for the mid review yet.
