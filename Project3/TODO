Implement transportC.nc and transportP.nc under lib/modules
 * The ones we need to work on for sure: socket, bind, listen, connect; maybe accept and close
 3/26/19 - Did socket bind and accept. Not sure if they work. I guess we can test once everything is done? 
           Still need listen connect and close.

 
* Setup and teardown
*** Start of data transfer, using simplest to implement stop and wait protocol. 

* Started working on setTestClient andd setTestServer. Haven't implemented timers that go inside those functions yet.
Still not too sure what exactly we have to implement for the mid review yet.
