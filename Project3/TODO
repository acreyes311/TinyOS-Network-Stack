* 4/11/19 - Changed the timers but not working properly.  transport.accept() returns NULL.
            The read/write loops in Timers dont work.

* 4/6/19 - Implement timers.
         - Implement rest of the DATA, DATA_ACK flags and FIN, ACK_FIN Flags(Teardown?).
         - Teardown(closeClient)
            
* 3/31/19 - I think in order to finish mid-review we need to do Transport read(),write(), and close().
            And then the TCPProtocol function, where flag 4 = read, flag 5 = write and flag 6 = close (teardown)
            Ive been using mostly vancu,aye,foreman or brimo
            ** Need to change Dijkstra variable names **
