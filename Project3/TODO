* 4/21/19 - Timers dont work. I think we may not end up using them.
          - Printing incorrect still.  I trie the globalTransfer/maxTransfer but idk what its doing really. Maybe just go back to how it
            was before.
          - Close/flag 6 still not entering.
          - Need to add comments to make demo easier.

* 4/19/19 - Timers still not correct
          - Print not correct
          - ClientClose that sends out packet with flag = 6 not entering. Maybe cause of our Confirmed or Socketlists again
          - accept still same

* 4/16/19 - Timers
            Print
            Teardown/ClientClose
            accept()

* 4/11/19 - Changed the timers but not working properly.  transport.accept() returns NULL.
            The read/write loops in Timers dont work.
            
           - Update
             Added flag = 4. 
                        ayeh/projtest calls readtimer in flag =3 and writeTimer in flag = 2
                        ayeh/160proj calls read in flag = 4 and write in flag = 5 ( No timers) Try this way?
                        forman write() flag = 3 and read() flag = 4.
           - Need to find where do they Print the data.

* 4/6/19 - Implement timers.
         - Implement rest of the DATA, DATA_ACK flags and FIN, ACK_FIN Flags(Teardown?).
         - Teardown(closeClient)
            
* 3/31/19 - I think in order to finish mid-review we need to do Transport read(),write(), and close().
            And then the TCPProtocol function, where flag 4 = read, flag 5 = write and flag 6 = close (teardown)
            Ive been using mostly vancu,aye,foreman or brimo
            ** Need to change Dijkstra variable names **
