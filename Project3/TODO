Implement transportC.nc and transportP.nc under lib/modules
 * The ones we need to work on for sure: socket, bind, listen, connect; maybe accept and close (maybe read)
 3/26/19 - Did socket bind and accept. Not sure if they work. I guess we can test once everything is done? 
           Still need listen connect and close.
           
* 3/28/19 - Need to work on the Timer (acceptTimer and writtenTimer(not sure about writtenTimer))
            Need to fix error for the TCPProtocol (bind (fd, &addr))
            
* 3/29/10 - I think in the ones that Don't use the TCPpack.h the first flag is set in Transport.connect(),(they set the flag to 1)
            and then the rest of the flags are set in that first (if flag ==1) block(in receive).
            
            Need to do Transport.connect()
            Fix 3-way receive
            
* 3/30/19 - Aaaaaah. I dont know how to fix that problem.  Hard to test any of the new stuff without that working.
            
            Still Need to TCPProtocol flag = 4 and the rest of it?
            Check that whatever we have in TransportP is correct.
            
* 3/31/10 - I think in order to finish mid-review we need to do Transport read(),write(), and close().
            And then the TCPProtocol function, where flag 4 = read, flag 5 = write and flag 6 = close (teardown)
            Ive been using mostly vancu,aye,foreman or brimo
            ** Need to change Dijkstra variable names **
            
* Setup and teardown
*** Start of data transfer, using simplest to implement stop and wait protocol.
