Implement transportC.nc and transportP.nc under lib/modules
 * The ones we need to work on for sure: socket, bind, listen, connect; maybe accept and close (maybe read)
 3/26/19 - Did socket bind and accept. Not sure if they work. I guess we can test once everything is done? 
           Still need listen connect and close.
           
* 3/28/19 - Need to work on the Timer (acceptTimer and writtenTimer(not sure about writtenTimer))
            Need to fix error for the TCPProtocol (bind (fd, &addr))
            
* 3/29/10 - I think in the ones that Don't use the TCPpack.h the first flag is set in Transport.connect(),(they set the flag to 1)
            and then the rest of the flags are set in that first (if flag ==1) block(in receive).
            
            Need to do Transport.connect()
            Fix 3-way receive
            
* 3/30/19 - Aaaaaah. I dont know how to fix that problem.  Hard to test any of the new stuff without that working.
            
            Still Need to TCPProtocol flag = 4 and the rest of it?
            
            
* Setup and teardown
*** Start of data transfer, using simplest to implement stop and wait protocol. 

* Started working on setTestClient andd setTestServer. (Haven't implemented timers that go inside those functions yet.)
Still not too sure what exactly we have to implement for the mid review yet.
